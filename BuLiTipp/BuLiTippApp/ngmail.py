USAGE: simply call send() to queue a mail.
The module will build a connection to smtp server, if not yet established, and send the mail asynchronously(each in a separate thread). The connection will be cancelled after $SESSION_TIMEOUT seconds.
If more mails are queued while connection is still established (for example in a for loop), the mails will queue and be sent one after another. Order is not preserved.
The cancelling of the connection will be queued as well, so if $SESSION_TIMEOUT seconds have passed, but there are still mails to send in the queue, first the mails will be sent, and if no mails are left, the connection will be cancelled.
So it is not guaranteed that the session will be terminated exactly after $SESSION_TIMEOUT seconds. But the connection will be terminated eventually.
If mails join the queue after the cancellation has been queued, the connection may terminate(after a successful sending), but will be re-established before sending any more new mails.
